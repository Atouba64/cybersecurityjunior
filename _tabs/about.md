# About CybersecurityJunior

CybersecurityJunior documents my transition from IT generalist to cloud security practitioner. What started as troubleshooting notes has grown into a public lab notebook packed with AWS builds, automation snippets, and candid career retrospectives.

## What You'll Find

- **Hands-on labs** that show every step, from provisioning VPCs to wiring automation around IAM, GuardDuty, Inspector, and more.
- **Career journals** that cover certification plans, interview lessons, and the realities of pivoting into security.
- **Automation recipes** with Python, Boto3, IaC, and CI/CD blueprints you can reuse in your own homelab or client work.

## Why I Publish Everything

I believe deliberate practice is easier when people can see the entire process—the mistakes, the rework, and the final architecture diagrams. By writing it all down, I stay accountable, track growth, and help other builders ship faster by reusing the same patterns.

## How to Navigate

- **Home**: the latest write‑ups and pinned milestones.
- **Labs**: curated technical walkthroughs you can clone step by step.
- **Posts**: the full archive with filters for categories, tags, and read time.

If you're building your first security automation or plotting the next career jump, I hope CybersecurityJunior gives you battle-tested references and the confidence to keep iterating. Let's ship secure systems together. 💻🛡️
