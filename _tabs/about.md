# About CybersecurityJunior

Welcome to **CybersecurityJunior**—a living documentation of my journey from IT generalist to cloud security and DevSecOps engineer. I'm **Mabele Liango**, and this site is my public lab notebook where I share everything I'm learning, building, and breaking as I transition into cybersecurity.

## The Mission

**Start Your Journey into Cybersecurity Today** isn't just a tagline—it's the core purpose of this site. Whether you're:
- Making a career transition into cybersecurity
- Building your first cloud security automation
- Preparing for certifications or interviews
- Looking for practical, hands-on tutorials

This site is designed to be the resource I wished existed when I started. Every post, lab, and code snippet comes from real work I've done, mistakes I've made, and solutions I've built.

## What You'll Find Here

### 📚 Technical Deep Dives
- **AWS Security**: IAM audits, S3 hardening, VPC networking, GuardDuty, Inspector, and compliance automation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform vs. Boto3 comparisons, CI/CD security gates, and automation patterns
- **Network Security**: Advanced networking with Transit Gateways, security group sprawl detection, and firewall auditing
- **Encryption & Compliance**: Encryption at rest vs. in transit, compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST), and automated compliance tooling

### 🛠️ Hands-On Automation
- **Python & Boto3**: Real-world automation scripts for AWS security, FinOps, and infrastructure management
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with OIDC, secure deployment pipelines, and infrastructure automation
- **Container Security**: Docker and Kubernetes security fundamentals, orchestration basics, and best practices

### 💼 Career & Strategy
- **Career Transition Guides**: From IT support to cloud security—the real, unpolished path
- **Portfolio Building**: The "Ghost Project" strategy and how to build experience before you get the job
- **Interview Prep**: DevSecOps interview strategies, technical preparation, and how to interview the interviewer
- **Certification Roadmaps**: Security+, AWS certifications, and practical study approaches

### 🔍 Discovery & Learning
- **Security Fundamentals**: Networking basics, encryption concepts, and security architecture
- **SIEM & Monitoring**: Elasticsearch SIEM basics, log analysis, and security event correlation
- **Tool Deep Dives**: Wireshark analysis, infrastructure auditing tools, and security automation frameworks

## Content Categories

The site covers content across these main areas:

- **Career**: Transition stories, interview strategies, portfolio building, and career growth
- **Technical**: Deep technical tutorials and explanations
- **Security**: Security best practices, vulnerabilities, and defense strategies
- **Network Security**: Advanced networking, firewall management, and network architecture
- **Compliance**: Compliance frameworks, audit automation, and regulatory requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud infrastructure, IaC, and infrastructure management
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, automation, and deployment strategies
- **DevSecOps**: Security integration into DevOps workflows
- **Cloud Management**: FinOps, resource optimization, and cloud governance

## Why I Publish Everything

I believe in **transparent learning** and **deliberate practice**. By documenting:
- The mistakes and rework
- The "why did that Terraform plan destroy everything?" moments
- The complete architecture diagrams and code
- The career pivots and interview experiences

I stay accountable, track my growth, and help others avoid the same pitfalls. If you can see the entire process—not just the polished final result—you can learn faster and build with confidence.

## The Tech Stack

This site focuses on practical, production-ready technologies:

| Area | Technologies |
