## Why This Site Exists

After five years in IT support, witnessing a ransomware incident firsthand pushed me toward prevention instead of cleanup. I created CybersecurityJunior to:

1. **Hold myself accountable** by shipping public work and documenting progress
2. **Share working code**, not just talking points—everything here is battle-tested
3. **Help other career-transitioners** by showing the unpolished, real path to cybersecurity
4. **Build in public** to prove that unconventional backgrounds can thrive in security through relentless practice
