# About Me

Hello! I'm **Mabele Liango**, and welcome to CybersecurityJunior—a space where I document my journey from IT support to cybersecurity professional.

## My Story

After spending 5 years in general IT support, I found myself at a crossroads. While I enjoyed troubleshooting and helping users, I craved something more challenging and strategic. The turning point came when I witnessed a ransomware attack at my company. Watching our team scramble to contain the damage, I realized I wanted to be on the prevention side—the one stopping attacks before they happen, not just cleaning up afterward.

That moment changed everything. I made the decision to transition into cybersecurity, and this website is a record of that journey—the successes, the failures, the certifications, the home labs, and everything in between.

## Why This Site Exists

When I started learning cybersecurity, I wished there was a resource that showed the real, unfiltered journey—not just the polished success stories. So I created this platform to:

- **Document my learning path** - From Security+ to building automated compliance tools
- **Share practical projects** - Home lab setups, AWS automation, and security tools
- **Reflect on the process** - The job search, interviews, and career transition challenges
- **Build community** - Connect with others on similar journeys

## What You'll Find Here

This site is part personal diary, part technical notebook. You'll discover:

- **Blog Posts** covering topics from networking basics to advanced AWS security
- **Home Lab Projects** documenting my hands-on learning experiments
- **Certification Journey** notes and study resources
- **Career Transition Stories** including how I passed the DevSecOps interview
- **Technical Tutorials** on topics like Python automation, Docker, Kubernetes, and more

## My Background

**Current Focus:**
- DevSecOps and Cloud Security
- AWS Security (IAM, S3, EC2, VPC)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD Security
- Compliance Frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST)

**Skills & Technologies:**
- Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure
- Programming: Python (Boto3), Bash scripting
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes
- Infrastructure: Terraform, Ansible
- Security Tools: Wireshark, SIEM (Elasticsearch)
- Certifications: CompTIA Security+ (in progress)

**Learning Path:**
1. Started with CompTIA Security+ for foundational knowledge
2. Built a home lab environment for hands-on practice
3. Completed TryHackMe labs and challenges
4. Focused on cloud security and DevSecOps
5. Developed automated compliance tools
6. Successfully transitioned to a cybersecurity role

## My Mission

I believe cybersecurity education should be accessible to everyone. Whether you're:
- Considering a career change into cybersecurity
- Already studying and looking for practical examples
- A fellow professional sharing similar experiences
- Someone curious about what it takes to break into the field

I hope my experiences can offer guidance, inspiration, or at the very least, a sense that you're not alone in this journey.

## A Note on Transparency

I share both successes and failures here. Not every project works perfectly, not every interview goes well, and not every certification attempt succeeds on the first try. But that's the reality of learning, and I believe being honest about the process helps others more than polished perfection.

## Let's Learn Together

If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to hear from you. Whether it's sharing resources, discussing projects, or just connecting with someone who understands the challenges—we're all in this together.
