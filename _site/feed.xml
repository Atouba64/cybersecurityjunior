  <summary>Here’s the reality: Your customers want to know their data is safe. Your partners need assurance. Regulators require proof. Compliance frameworks provide that proof. But they can seem overwhelming - SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, HIPAA… Let’s break them down so you understand what they actually mean and why they matter.   What is Compliance, Really?  Compliance means following rules, standard...</summary>

  <summary>The old way: You need a VPC, some EC2 instances, and an S3 bucket. You log into AWS console, click around for an hour, create everything manually, and hope you remember what you did. The new way: You write code that defines your infrastructure. Run a command, and everything is created. Need to change something? Update the code. Need to recreate it? Run the code again. That’s Infrastructure as C...</summary>

  <summary>The challenge: You’ve built an amazing application. Now you need to deploy it. Manually deploying is slow and error-prone. CI/CD automates this. But here’s the problem: if your pipeline isn’t secure, attackers can inject malicious code, steal secrets, or deploy vulnerable software. Let’s learn how to build secure CI/CD pipelines.   What is CI/CD, Really?  CI/CD stands for:    CI (Continuous Int...</summary>

  <summary>Here’s the reality: Security events happen constantly. Failed login attempts, unusual network traffic, configuration changes - thousands of events every minute. Manually reviewing logs is impossible. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems collect, analyze, and alert on these events automatically. Elasticsearch is often the engine behind SIEM solutions. Let’s learn how it works...</summary>

  <summary>Think of it this way: When you create an AWS account, you get a default VPC - like a basic apartment building. It works, but it’s not optimized for security. Building your own VPC is like designing a custom office building with proper security zones, controlled access, and network segmentation. Let’s learn how to build secure VPC architectures.   What is a VPC, Really?  A VPC (Virtual Private C...</summary>
