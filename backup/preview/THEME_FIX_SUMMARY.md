# Chirpy Theme Fix Summary

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**
   - Theme mode toggle button is now present in the sidebar
   - Button ID: `mode-toggle` 
   - Located in sidebar-bottom section
   - JavaScript (`theme.min.js`) is loading correctly

2. **CSS Styles**
   - Chirpy theme CSS is being generated correctly (68KB file)
   - CSS path: `/assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.css`
   - Bootstrap CSS is loading from CDN
   - All theme assets are present

## 🔍 To Verify Everything Works

1. **View the site through Jekyll server** (NOT by opening HTML files directly):
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   Then visit: http://localhost:4000

2. **Clear browser cache** or use incognito/private mode

3. **Check for the toggle button**: Look at the bottom-left of the sidebar for a button with an adjust/contrast icon (⚙️)

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Static HTML pages** (in `pages/`, `legal/`, `auth/`) are NOT using Jekyll layouts, so they won't have the Chirpy theme styling. Only pages generated by Jekyll (posts, index, etc.) will have the theme.

- **Jekyll-generated pages** (posts, index, categories, tags) will have the full Chirpy theme styling and the dark/light toggle.

- If styles aren't showing:
  1. Make sure you're viewing via `http://localhost:4000` (not file://)
  2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
  3. Check browser console for any errors (F12 → Console tab)

## 🎯 Theme Mode Toggle

The toggle button should appear in the sidebar at the bottom when `theme_mode` is empty (which it is now). Click it to switch between light and dark modes.
