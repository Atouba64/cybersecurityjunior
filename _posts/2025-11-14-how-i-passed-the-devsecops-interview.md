So, you landed the interview for that "Cloud Security Engineer" or "DevSecOps Engineer" role. Congratulations! Now comes the hard part. These interviews are intense. They aren't just about what you know; they're about *how you think* and *how you connect your skills*.

I just went through two of these interviews back-to-back. I'm a cybersecurity professional, and English isn't even my first language, which can make technical interviews extra stressful. But I learned that the right preparation makes all the difference. It's not about memorizing 100 AWS services. It's about having a playbook.

Here is the exact playbook I used to prepare. I hope it helps you, too.

## 1. The "Big Secret": You're Not a Candidate, You're a "Persona"

This was the biggest insight. The job description (JD) isn't just a list of requirements; it's a **character sheet**. The company is looking for a specific *persona*. My job wasn't to be "Mabele, the guy who knows Python," it was to *be* the person they described.

Your resume is your **backstory**. The interview is your **performance**. Read the JD and find 3-5 keywords that define your persona. Write them down. Be that person.

## 2. Your Superpower: The STAR Method

If you are a non-native English speaker like me, the **STAR method** is your best friend. It replaces the need for a big vocabulary with pure, undeniable *logic*. It shows *how you think*.

**My Pro-Tip:** I add a 5th letter, **'A' for Automation**. After your "Result," add this: "And the *final* step was, I wrote a Python script to automate that check so the problem could never happen again." This is how you prove you have the DevSecOps mindset.

## 3. Your Resume is Your "Proof" - Every Answer Must Connect

Your resume isn't just to get the interview; it's your *script*. You must connect every answer you give back to a specific bullet point or project on your resume. This builds incredible credibility.

## 4. The 5 Pillars of the DevSecOps Interview

These roles are "T-shaped." You need to be *deep* in one or two areas (like AWS Security or Python Automation) and *broad* in all the others:

1. **Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)** - You MUST be an expert
2. **Automation (Python, Bash, PowerShell)** - You MUST be a "doer"
3. **CI/CD & IaC** - You are the "Sec" in "DevSecOps"
4. **Compliance** - Non-negotiable for public-sector work
5. **Soft Scenarios** - Where you prove you are the "Partner" persona

## 5. How to Handle "I Don't Know"

You will get a question you don't know. It's a test. Do *not* lie. Do *not* panic. Use this 3-step script:

1. **Be Honest**
2. **Explain What You DO Know (The Theory)**
3. **State Your Learning Process**

This answer is *better* than a perfect technical definition. It shows integrity and a growth mindset.

## Final Thoughts

The interview is not a test. It is a conversation to see if you are the person they are looking for. Use your resume as your proof, use STAR as your logic, and use the job description as your "persona."

You have the skills. Now go show them.
