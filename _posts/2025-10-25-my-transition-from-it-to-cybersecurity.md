It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. After 5 years in general IT support, I felt stuck. I was good at fixing computers and helping users, but I wanted something more challenging, more strategic. Cybersecurity called to me like a siren song—complex, ever-changing, and absolutely critical.

## The Wake-Up Call

It started with a ransomware attack at my company. Watching our IT team scramble to contain the damage, I realized something: I wanted to be the person preventing these attacks, not just cleaning up after them. The incident opened my eyes to how vulnerable we all are and how much we need skilled defenders.

## The Skills Gap

Coming from general IT, I had some advantages but also significant gaps:

**✅ What I Had:**
- Strong troubleshooting skills
- Understanding of networks
- Experience with Windows/Linux
- Customer service mindset

**❌ What I Lacked:**
- Security frameworks knowledge
- Risk assessment skills
- Incident response experience
- Compliance understanding

## My Learning Path

I didn't have a formal plan, but here's what I did:

1. **CompTIA Security+:** Started here for foundational knowledge
2. **Home Lab:** Built a virtual environment to practice
3. **TryHackMe:** Hands-on labs and challenges
4. **Networking:** Joined local cybersecurity meetups
5. **Specialization:** Focused on incident response

## The Job Search Reality

This was the hardest part. I applied to over 50 positions and got maybe 5 interviews. The feedback was consistent: "Great technical skills, but no security experience." It was frustrating, but I kept pushing.

> **The Breakthrough:** I finally got my break through a cybersecurity internship program. Yes, an internship—at 28 years old! But it was worth it. The company saw my potential and offered me a full-time role after 3 months.
> 
> Lesson: Sometimes you have to take a step back to move forward.

## What I Wish I Knew

- **Start with fundamentals:** Don't jump into advanced topics without understanding the basics
- **Build a portfolio:** Document your learning journey and projects
- **Network actively:** Attend meetups, join online communities
- **Be patient:** Career transitions take time, especially in cybersecurity
- **Stay curious:** The field changes constantly, embrace continuous learning

## Where I Am Now

Six months into my cybersecurity role, I'm handling incident response, conducting vulnerability assessments, and helping develop our security policies. The learning curve is steep, but every day brings new challenges and growth opportunities.

> **💡 Advice for Fellow Transitioners:** If you're considering a similar transition, start now. The cybersecurity skills gap is real, and companies are looking for people with the right mindset and willingness to learn. Your IT background is an asset, not a liability—use it to your advantage.
